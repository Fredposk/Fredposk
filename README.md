Hello, this is **Frederico** 👋 
-

I'm an **iOS Developer**  living in **Berlin**  🇩🇪 building apps and working on an examination platform for aviation ✈️ students.
 
I love **Swift** and **iOS Development** 📱.

I have flight licenses from Brazil 🇧🇷 and Poland 🇵🇱 and aviation is my hobby. 

I love being part of development of mobile technologies.

I like to participate in iOS groups learning and helping 🤝 

I build things while exploring concepts and put them on GitHub. 

Currently working through: 
- 📚   [ **Modern Concurrency in Swift**](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/modern-concurrency-in-swift/v1.0)
